# Lung Cancer Detection  

Early detection of lung cancer can significantly improve recovery and survival rates. This application leverages a CNN model trained on thousands of high-resolution lung scans to accurately detect cancerous lesions. By reducing false positives, this model ensures timely intervention and allows radiologists to focus on patient care.
